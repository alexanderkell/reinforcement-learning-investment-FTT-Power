function [CostsOut,TPED,CF,POut,CSCDataOut] = FTT21x24v8CostCurves(CostsIn,G,P,CSCData,D,Efficiency,CSCType,dt)
%---Function that gives the costs as given by cost-supply curves as well as
%---    the inverse pricing problem
%---In the case of fossil fuels, it is the fuel costs that change
%---    with the price of carriers calculated here
%---    i.e. Coal, Oil, Gas, nuclear get more expensive with depletion
%---    Following the inverse problem (see Mercure&Salas2012b)
%---    This calculation is global!! It occurs once per time step, not per region
%---In the case of renewables, it is the 
%---        Capacity factor that changes (wind, solar, wave)
%---        Investment term (Hydro, Geothermal, Tidal)
%---        Fuel term for renewable fuels (biomass, biogas)
%---    i.e. best renewable sites taken first, then capacity factor decreases
%---
%---CostsIn is the 3D costs matrix at time t per region (Excel spreadsheet)
%---    New fuel costs values are given to exhaustible resources
%---    New capacity factors, Investment, fuel costs are given to renewables
%---G is the matrix NETxNWR of current energy generation by the technology in GWh/y (NET:24)
%---    This is because FTT works in GWh
%---P is the global vector of carrier prices in $/GJ (NNR:13)
%---CSCData are the cost curves for all technologies in TWh/y
%---    This is because CSC_gui_v3 works in TWh
%---    It is returned CSCDataOut since densities of stock resources gradually deplete

%======Add the capacities or energy sources for technologies that compete
%   for the same resources
%   (for ex.: Coal or Coal + CCS use the same fuel)
%   (       : All biomass are in competition except biogas)
%   (       : Solar PV and CSP compete for space)
%Moreover, the combined generation must not exceed the technical potentials
%GR is the variable of energy use by resource type (NNR:13)
%Convert back generation into fuel use (from GWh to PJ):
%Sum up competing technologies (from GWh to TWh)
%Note: the inclusion of components of D relates to exogenous non-power demand (GJ to PJ)
%Note: The CSCurves in CSCData are in TWh/y for renewables and PJ for fuels (including biofuels)
%      Costs are in $/MWh for renewables and $/GJ for fuels (including biofuels)
%Note:D(1) is in GWh/y (not use here), while D(2:6) is in PJ (non power demand)
