%---FTT20x24: Third prototype of the ETM in 20 world regions
%---ETM24: Second prototype of the ETM single global region
%---SmallETM: First prototype 6 technologies
%---Based on cost distributions
%---24 Technologies
%---Using costs from IEA Projected costs of generating electricity
%---Uses excel spreadsheet ETM24v2.xls
%---Starting from SmallETMv1:
%---SmallETMv2:
%---    Added learning using:
%---        Equation for Demand D, investment I
%---        Equation for Capacity U, cumulative investment W
%---        Learning equation decreasing costs C
%---    Added to spreadsheet
%---        Decomission rates
%---        IEA projection data for demand D following new policies scenario
%---        IEA 2008 data for starting capacity U and capacity factors
%---        IEA 2008 data for starting shares S
%---        Starting cumulative investment W set equal to U
%---SmallETMv3
%---    Added calculation of CO2 emissions
%---    Added a carbon price as exogenous, starting with today's price and
%---        increasing at specified rate
%---    Added cost associated with carbon price and rates of emissions per technology
%---    Added taxes/subsidies (constant throughout)
%---    Allowed Aij to be not symmetric, where switching times from i to j need
%---        not be equal to that from j to i
%---    Added in spreadsheet values for Aij from plant lifetimes
%---SmallETMv4
%---    Added the dynamic limits of shares: gas, wind and solar are
%---        interdependent, along with static values for the demand profile
%---        and storage
%---    Changed Aij to use plant lifetime and build times: Aij = 10/sqrt(ti*tj)
%---ETM24v1
%---    New ETM: upgraded to 24 technologies
%---    Used cost values by making my own statistics of values in
%---        Proj. Costs. Gen. Elect., IEA, 2010
%---        Technologies are the ones for which this ref. has data
%---    Used Learning rates from various sources (not TCET): McDonald, IEA,guesses
%---    Used matrix Aij as 10/ti*10/tj,
%---        ti: lifetime, tj: lead time
%---    Strong interaction between technologies (ex: CCGT and Biogas)
%---    Added emission factors from IPCC Guidelines 2006
%---        Biomass CCS have negative emissions and get money from carbon trading
%---    Added matrix of spillover learning Bij
%---        Mixes learning in different categories
%---ETM24v2
%---    Added in the code the calculation of the levelised costs LCOE
%---        [LCOE, dLCOE] = ETM24LCOE(Costs,r)
%---        Reads cost data from spreadsheet
%---        Rebuilds LCOE the same way as was done previously in excel
%---        Rebuilds LCOE at each time step
%---    Added cost curves
%---        [Costs,Depletion] = ETM24CostCurves(Costs,GWh',U',CCurves);
%---        Using for now functional form: C(U) = -B/log(U/Umax) + C0
%---        Caution!!!: Share limits Shat and cost curves can clash:
%---            If we force to keep a share, we end up using more resouce than available
%---        LCOE calculation uses cost curves to change Ft, It or Capacity factors
%---            as resources get depleted
%---        Added variable Depletion which calculates % resources left
%---        Added variable GWh which cumulates energy produced
%---    Updated shares limit equation using only one line (!!!)
%---        Uses conditional information from spreadsheet (baseload, flexible or variable)
%---    Changed share limits system to remove their 'stickyness'
%---        We have Gi_min, Gj_max, Gj_min and Gi_max
%---        Shares stop at limit but can now bounce back, don't stick to limit
%---ETM24v3
%---    Set of equations relating S to U are inconsistent. Need a change.
%---    See Latex notes: SHARES ARE OF CAPACITY, NOT GENERATION
%---    This version changes equations for U, I, E, W, but not S
%---    We move away completely from Anderson + Winne, the source of the inconsistency
%---    Equation for investment and => capacity of A+W was inconsistent.
%---    Now the cost curves work properly
%---    Verified consistency for values for capacity, generation, emissions
%---    Made the capacity factors time dependent
%---        Flexible sources CF change as if variable renewables or demandprofile change
%---        Variable renewable CF change when number of units change since they all 
%---            have differenc CFs
%---    MADE SYSTEM INDEPENDENT OF TIME INTERVAL dt
%---        In some cases where changes dSij are large, using shorter dt prevents crashes
%---        When dSij is too large compared to dt, S sometimes go negative or complex
%---        Empirical observation: system may crash if Aij*dt > 5
%---        System gives very similar results for smaller and smaller dt 
%---            (dt = 1/4 is a good value)
%---    NOTE: This version (v3) is working and extensively tested.
%---          It follows exactly the equations that describe it
%---          See Tyndall Working Paper 148
%---ETM24v4
%---    We have built a new set of cost-supply curves for 20 regions and 13
%---      types of natural resources. ETM24v4 is still a single region model
%---      and we use it to test the global aggregated cost-supply curves. It
%---      should compare favourably with (v3), i.e. improved accuracy.
%---      However, no conceptual changes are included, apart from the following:
%---    1- Cost-supply curves are now interpolations into data given by CSC_GUI_v3
%---    2- Cost-supply curves progress according to total generation value (G(t))
%---    3- We do not need the 'resources' sheet of ETM24v3.xls
%---    4- Instead we read the text file ETM24v4CSCData.txt
%---    Some Cost calues in the new excel spreadsheet are updated (ETM24v4.xls)
%---    We get however problems with the cost curves for fossil fuels 
%---      compared with Rogner curves, which were better behaved. 
%---    Additional fix: there was a missing constraint for baseload capacity
%---      This is now represented as a second share limit Shat2
%---    The model description is accepted in Energy Policy!!
%---      Calculations for this were made using a hybrid Rogner/New CSCurves version
%---      ETM24v3-ResUpdate.m
%---ETM24v4.5
%---    Major change: we introduced the inverse price problem for stock resources.
%---      Stock resource fuel terms are now calculated using fuel prices (marginal costs)
%---      Prices are calculated in ETM24v45CostCurves.m and held in variable P
%---      P is a vector 13 elements long: Number of Natural Resources types NNR
%---      i.e. now stock resources are supplied by a range of resource costs
%---      The depletion occurs with exploitation frequency nu0 (See Tyndall Paper 2)
%---      !!This apparently fixes the problem for Stock resources and we 
%--       can now remove the Rogner curves!!
%---    Added historical data for plotting from IEA electricity generation data
%---      This data is now included in ETM24v45.xls
%---    For generation projections to fit historical data, we now start
%---      from generation data and find the capacities from assumed CFs
%---    The construction of a GUI enables to better separate the code from the assumptions. 
%---      The assumptions Spreadsheet(s) should now be kept separate
%---      We have 2 scenarios at this point
%---ETM24v5
%---    Many assumptions are made time dependent:
%---      Electricity demand, carbon price, non-power demand for resources 
%---      and time dependent subsidies/taxes are specified in the spreadsheet
%---      We now have up to 10 scenarios in memory simultaneously
%---    This is the most stable version and possibly final for the global model
%---    It finally uses correctly all of the cost-supply curves of the paper but 
%---      also including biogas and offshore (not in the paper)
%---    External assumptions were all derived from Terry's E3MG book simulations
%---FTT20x24v1
%---    We now multiply the model by 20 or 21 E3MG regions
%---      Dimensionality changes: all variables are 3D prisms (NET, NWR, t)
%---      with time in the 3rd dimension. Assumptions file is consequently larger
%---      Region definition can be changed!! If we have the right assumptions
%---    We are now using all individual cost-supply curves for renewables (180 curves)
%---      and the inverse problem (global) for traded fossil fuels (4 densities)
%---    The speed was improved dramatically by replacing the erf function by tanh (factor ~2x)
%---      It was also improved by using the symmetry dSij = -dSji (factor ~2x)
%---      (4.21min -> 1.00min for 2008 -> 2050 in 21 regions, 15s for reading the xlsx)
%---    A functionality for saving and loading calculated scenarios was added to the GUI
%---    A functionality for exporting results into excel or text files was added
%---    A spreadsheet of common LCOE adjustments for all scenarios was added
%---      This simplifies and enables the baseline to have zero technology support or taxes
%---      A good check was performed whether share limits are respected IMPORTANT!!
%---        The model when outside limits gives very strange results
%---FTT20x24v2
%---    Changed the way the GUI saves the data, now into Common Data Format files
%---    Changed the structure of the Excel spreadsheet to make changes more copy-pastable
%---FTT21x24v2
%---    After integration into E3MG, this has become a MPhil student use version
%---    E3MG-FTT2 (E3MGCCv1) can use the same input spreadsheets
%---    Outputs of the 2 models are not identical, but to make them is
%---    difficult given that E3MG-FTT has the economy endogenous and iterates
%---FTT21x24v3
%---    This version was tested by Tomohiro and Kerensa in 2014
%---    Also opensource and available on 4CMR website
%---    In Jan 2015, for use in LE course EP06, I tried to make outputs identical.
%---    LCOEs we not defined in exactly the same way, fixed. Still differences
%---FTT21x24v4
%---    Here I make the regulations time series instead of F matrices
%---    I also remove the use of spreadsheet based location of parameters
%---    Simplified the scenario management in the interface
%---FTT53x24v5
%---    We bring back E3ME-FTT version into Matlab for students, in 53
%---    regions, using the same input spreadsheets, to make the models identical
%---    For this I scrap the FTT:Power interface and use the more advanced FTT-Tr one
%---FTT59x24v6
%---    Add new E3ME regions into FTT
%---    Add new gamma parameters similar to FTT-Tr to make diffusion continuous across start of simulation
%---    For this, add new interface. These numbers will be used in E3ME
%---FTT59x24v7
%---    Major upgrade regarding data and start date. We now use IEA Proj Costs 2015
%---        Start date of simulation changes from 2008 to 2013
%---        Changes to the natural resources database for solar and wind capacity factors
%---        Changes were made first in E3ME NERC version 
%---FTT59x24v8Unc
%---    Includes new parameters for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
%---FTT61v24v8FTC
%---    New major development with electricity market
%---    Includes 61 E3ME regions
%---    Has Gamma values to fit diffusion rates to history
%---    Has new residual load-duration curves system
%---    Has new dispatch model calculation (electricity market model)
%---    v8.1 Has start date 2017 with new IEA data
